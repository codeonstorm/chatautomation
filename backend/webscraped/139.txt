# What is IP Filter and how to create rules?
IP Filters are rules you can apply to your records that if a user meets the requirement(s) of the filter, they will be answered with that record. Otherwise, they will be answered with the World/Default. Filters can be created for: regions, countries, cities, ASN (Autonomous System Network) of the resolving name server, /24 IPv4 EDNS client subnet, and /120 IPv6 EDNS client subnet. The IP Filter is Available for A, AAAA, CNAME, and ANAME records.
