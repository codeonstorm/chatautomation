Aug 07, 2024●54s read 
1. Payment methods include PayPal, prepaid debit cards, or direct deposit electronic ACH bank transfer payments to an affiliate’s bank account.
2. Affiliate payouts are processed every 30 days from the previous payout date. To request a payout as an affiliate, the minimum withdrawal amount must be $500, and only referrals 120+ days old are eligible for withdrawal. For example, if an affiliate requests a withdrawal on August 1, 2024, they will receive commissions earned up to April 1, 2024.
3. All payments are made in USD.
4. Any chargebacks filed by the affiliate’s client will be deducted or payable by the affiliate. The affiliate agrees to return the commission if chargebacks or disputes are filed by the affiliate’s client.
5. Upon detecting fraudulent activity, 5centsCDN can deny any commission payout.
6. Affiliates are responsible for bearing all taxes associated with the payment, including any potential fees charged by their bank or payment method provider.
7. After 1 year of the customer using the services, if the affiliate has not claimed their commission, it will no longer be available for them.
