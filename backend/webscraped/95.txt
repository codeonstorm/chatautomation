# How to enable Secure Token and how it works
Secure Token is one of the enhanced security feature addon provided by 5centsCDN. Secure Token allows you to generate secured playback links with an expiration time. Once a token has expired, it is not possible anymore to access the content with it. This will make your content secure to a great extend and prevent playback URL theft.
