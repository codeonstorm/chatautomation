# How can I enable Live Transcoding for Live Streaming?
Live transcoding is the process of converting a live video feed into multiple versions with different resolutions and bitrates (e.g., 1080p, 720p, 480p). This ensures that live content is accessible across a wide range of devices and network conditions, providing an optimized viewing experience for all users.
