# How to create a project in Video Manager?
Video Manager allows us to upload videos to the cloud and schedule them as playlists. The playlist can be embedded on the clients’ websites. The users can then watch the videos from the playlist. In a video manager, the root is known as a project. 5centsCDN’s control panel requires the creation of a project before setting up the video manager. Video uploads and playlist creation can be created within the project.
From the Dashboard, click o 'Video Manager'
