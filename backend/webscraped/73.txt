# What is Traffic Director & Health Check?
Aug 06, 2024●26s read 
Our intelligent traffic management service makes it easy to implement a multi-CDN infrastructure that puts you in control of performance and cost. You can simply start with a strategy that directs traffic to the preferred CDN based on the country, state, or ASN (autonomous system number) of your users. 
**Health Check** tests the performance of your server to ensure it’s online. Health Check allows us to determine the status of the server so that the traffic director can switch to the available server if the primary goes offline.
