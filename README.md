1Ô∏è‚É£ python-jose[cryptography]
Purpose: Handles JWT authentication (JSON Web Tokens) to secure WebSocket communication.

jose (JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption) is a lightweight library to create and verify JWTs.
The [cryptography] part is an extra dependency that ensures secure signing and verification of JWTs.
üí° Why?

Ensures that only authenticated users can access chat.
Prevents unauthorized access to WebSocket endpoints.
Uses secure algorithms (e.g., HS256, RS256) for token signing.
2Ô∏è‚É£ passlib
Purpose: Handles password hashing securely.

Why not store plain text passwords? ‚Üí That would be a security risk!
passlib provides bcrypt, a strong hashing algorithm used to store passwords securely.
üí° Why?

Prevents password leaks from exposing raw passwords.
bcrypt automatically adds a salt to protect against rainbow table attacks.
Hashes passwords securely so that even if a database is compromised, the passwords remain safe.
